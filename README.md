The **ATtiny 45 and 85 Development Board** is a development board for the ATtiny 45 and 85 microcontroller.

Features:

 * All ÂµC pins broken out
 * Power LED
 * Reset switch
 * ISP headers 
 * Open Source; OSHW compliant
 * Design files freely available

In this repository you will find the gerber files for BatchPCB (http://batchpcb.com) and DorkbotPDX (http://dorkbotpdx.org/wiki/pcb_order),
along with project (.pro), board (.brd) and schematic (.sch) files for the board in the 'EAGLE and 'KiCad' folders.

You can also find this design on BatchPCB ready to add to your cart: http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/73630

**This board will be under continual change and versions may not work the way they are supposed to. You have been warned**

INSTALLATION
------------
**EAGLE**
The design is saved as an EAGLE project. EAGLE PCB design software is available from www.cadsoftusa.com 
free for non-commercial use and can be installed on Windows and Mac, with Linux support through WINE. 
To use this project download it and place the directory containing these files into the "eagle" directory 
on your computer. Then open EAGLE and navigate to Projects -> eagle -> ATtiny_45_and_85_development_board.

**KiCad**
KiCad EDA Suite is an Open Source alternative to EAGLE. It is available on Windows and Linux and can be installed 
on Mac. It is available from http://kicad.sourceforge.net and works in a similar way to EAGLE. You will find project 
files for KiCad in the aptly named folder in this repository. To use this project download it and place the directory 
containing these files into a folder of your choice. Then open KiCad and navigate to File -> Open -> 
'FOLDER_OF_YOUR_CHOICE' -> ATtiny_45_and_85_development_board.pro
